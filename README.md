# Function Calling Benchmark by [Composio](https://composio.dev)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Composio's Function Calling Benchmark. This repository contains a benchmark of 50 function calling problems, each of which is designed to be solved using one of the 8 function schemas provided, which are inspired from some of ClickUp's integration endpoints. 

## Overview

The benchmark is designed to test the ability of various models to correctly call functions based on given prompts, and solve the situation in a ClickUp workspace using one of the given functions. Each question in the benchmark presents a scenario that requires the use of a specific function to solve. The function schemas provided outline the structure and parameters of the functions that can be used.

> Note that, a speciality of this benchmark is, problems are designed to test the abilities of the models to handle real world API structurs, and performance against differnet optimizations.
> 
## Repository Structure

- [`prompts/`](prompts/): Propmts used to check & modify the Problems and Schema.
- [`clickup_space_benchmark.json`](clickup_space_benchmark.json): The problems and correct solutions.
- [`clickup_space_schema.json`](clickup_space_schema.json): Function Schema's that the LLMs use to solve the problems of the Benchmark.
- `*.ipynb`: Different optimization techniques, applied to the LLMs to check their performance against the Benchmark.

> We did the all experimentations on notebooks now, as it is easier to keep track of the results.

## Running the Benchmark

We have tested different function calling models,  Resut notebooks of which are stored in each seperate branch. 

Currently we have experimented with:
* `gpt-4-turbo-preview` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/gpt-4-turbo-preview)
* `gpt-4-turbo` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/gpt-4-turbo)
* `gpt-4-0125-preview` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/gpt-4-0125-preview)
* `claude-3-haiku-20240307` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/claude-3-haiku-20240307)
* `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
* `claude-3-opus-20240229` - [branch](https://github.com/SamparkAI/Composio-Function-Calling-Benchmark/tree/claude-3-opus-20240229)

## Experiments

All these different optimizations has been tested with the models, and each of the techniques are explained [here](https://blog.composio.dev/gpt-4-function-calling-example/).
